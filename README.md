These are my personal notes from studying the utterly fantastic Learn You A Haskell from Miran Lipovača.

You can find a free online version of the book at http://learnyouahaskell.com/ but I HIGHLY recommend that you
buy a copy and support the author.

He seems like a cool guy.

Plus his drawings are epic.
